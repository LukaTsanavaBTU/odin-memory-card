# Memory Card

A memory card game made with React for an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card). The images are fetched from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).<br>You can view [the live webpage here](https://lukatsanava-memory-card.netlify.app/).

## What I Practiced While Working On The Project
- Using effect hooks;
- Fetching information from an external API;
- Working with and displaying data fetched from an API.
